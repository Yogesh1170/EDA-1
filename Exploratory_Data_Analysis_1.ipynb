In the context of a student performance dataset, such as one used to predict exam scores, the process of feature engineering typically involves the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Understanding**:\n",
        "   - Start by thoroughly understanding the dataset. Examine the structure, content, and relationships between variables. This step is crucial to identify which variables are relevant for predicting student performance.\n",
        "\n",

You can use statistical tests, correlation analysis, domain knowledge, and exploratory data analysis to help you decide which features are important. Variables that are strongly correlated with exam scores or have theoretical significance should be retained.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handling Categorical Variables**:\n",
        "   - If the dataset contains categorical variables (e.g., gender, ethnicity, school type), you need to encode them as numerical values. Common techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or binary encoding, depending on the nature of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dealing with Missing Data**:\n",
        "   - Address missing data in the dataset. You can choose to impute missing values using techniques like mean imputation, regression imputation, or model-based imputation, or consider excluding rows or columns with excessive missing data if it's justified.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
        "   - Normalize or standardize numerical features, so they have the same scale. Common scaling techniques include Min-Max scaling (rescaling features to a specific range) or Z-score standardization (mean-centering and dividing by the standard deviation).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Feature Creation**:\n",
        "   - Create new features that might capture underlying patterns or relationships in the data. For example, you could create a feature representing the average of math and reading scores if they are available in the dataset, as it might be a better predictor of overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Binning or Discretization**:\n",
        "   - Transform numerical variables into categorical bins or ranges if it makes sense. For instance, you can group students' ages into age brackets or divide exam scores into grade categories (e.g., \"Fail,\" \"Pass,\" \"Distinction\").\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Feature Transformation**:\n",
        "   - Consider transforming features to make them more suitable for modeling. This might involve applying mathematical operations like taking the square root or logarithm of a variable to correct skewness.\n",

Skewness measures the asymmetry of the feature's distribution. Positive skew indicates a long tail on the right, while negative skew indicates a long tail on the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Create histograms and density plots for each feature to visually inspect their distributions. This will help you identify features with non-normal distributions.\n",
        "   - Generate quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots to compare the distribution of each feature with a normal distribution. Deviations from a straight line in a Q-Q plot can indicate non-normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test to formally test the normality of each feature. The null hypothesis is that the data follows a normal distribution. A low p-value suggests non-normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Identify Non-Normal Features**: Based on summary statistics, visual inspection, Q-Q plots, and statistical tests, identify features that exhibit non-normality. Common non-normal patterns include right-skewed (positively skewed) or left-skewed (negatively skewed) distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Transformations to Improve Normality**:\n",
        "   - **Logarithmic Transformation**: For right-skewed data, you can apply a logarithmic transformation (e.g., natural logarithm) to compress the right tail and make the distribution more symmetric.\n",
        "   - **Square Root Transformation**: This transformation is useful for data with a square root relationship, such as count data.\n",
        "   - **Box-Cox Transformation**: The Box-Cox transformation is a family of power transformations that can be applied to stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed. It requires estimating the lambda (λ) parameter for each feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Data Visualization After Transformation**: Create histograms, density plots, and Q-Q plots for the transformed features to assess whether the transformations have improved normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Recheck Normality**: Rerun the Shapiro-Wilk test or other normality tests to see if the transformed features now follow a more normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Statistical Inference**: Depending on your analysis goals, consider the impact of the transformed features on any statistical tests, modeling, or machine learning algorithms you plan to use. Transformed data may yield more reliable results in some cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that the choice of transformation should be guided by the characteristics of the data and the goals of your analysis. Some features may require different transformations, and you should exercise caution when applying transformations to real-world data to avoid unintended consequences. Additionally, the Wine Quality dataset contains both red and white wine data, so you may want to perform EDA separately for each type of wine if they have different distributions."
